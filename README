Cisco/IPPhone version 0.01
============================

Cisco::IPPhone - Package for creating Cisco IPPhone XML applications

This Cisco IPPhone module was created to provide a simple convenient
method to display Cisco IP Phone objects and gather input from a Cisco
7940 or 7960 IP Phone.  This module supports all known Cisco XML objects
for 7940 and 7960 phones.  Knowledge of Cisco XML syntax is not a requirement.

This Perl module gives the ability to use simple PERL objects to display XML on the IP Phone unlike to Cisco Software Development Kit (SDK) which uses Microsoft IIS Server, ASP's, JSP's, Javascript, COM Objects, and requires knowledge of XML syntax. 

Requirements:

Developing Cisco IPPhone XML applications using the Cisco::IPPhone module requires the following:
 - Cisco CallManager Software or the CallManager Emulator Software
 - Any web server capable of running Perl CGI (Apache, etc)
 - A Cisco 7940 or 7960 IPPhone for testing the applications

Graphics:

Use cip2gif, gif2cip, or the photoshop plugin to create the cip files
and use the data portion of the cip file in your Perl XML objects.

The following list gives typical services that might be supplied to a phone:

 - Weather
 - Stock information
 - Contact information
 - Company news
 - To-do lists
 - Real-time NFL scores
 - Daily schedule

If you would like your XML app distributed with this module under the examples
directory on CPAN, please email the app to Mark Palmer - markpalmer@us.ibm.com
